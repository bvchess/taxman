# Forced members and nogoods (2026-10, second round)

Part of the [lab notebook](../../README.md).

Measured with the ladder on one thread (deterministic node counts) with the
frontier's tactics (`revise_freedoms=off`), seeded from n−1 (from
`results/strict.jsonl` past 1000, `--known`), on a fast set that each finish
in under 25 s: 880, 936, 1050 (optimum found late), 1100, 1170, 1184 (proof
only).  (The first rows were measured while a production run used 6 cores,
the rest on an idle machine; the first row measured again idle came out the
same to 1%.)  Where the time went at 1184 (`sample`): peeling for conflicts 29%
(nearly all of it minimizing them), matching repairs for refinement 18% and
for strong branching 16%, the candidate filter's peels 16%.

The tree is mostly chains: at four nodes in five the node's loop ends right
after its first child, because removing the member that strong branching
chose already brings the bound below what the node needs.  That member is
*forced*: every completion that beats the incumbent promotes it.  Strong
branching computes the bound without each member of the conflict, and at
1184 more than one member was forced at 54% of the nodes (two at 16%, three
at 10%, four or more at 28%).  Before, the child promoted one of them and
found the others again, one level each, further down.

* **Forced members** (tactic `fix_forced`, sound).  The child promotes every
  forced member of the conflict, not only the chosen one: the child's
  completions are some of the node's, so those that beat the incumbent
  promote them all, and if one cannot be promoted any more (or the child's
  candidate filter dropped it) the child has no such completion at all.
  Nodes −31% (880) to −60% (1170), time −21% to −36%.
* **Reusing the child check.**  A child's bound is checked (with refinement
  and its conflict) when it is made; its loop's first step repeated that with
  the same need for the same verdict.  It now keeps the verdict.  And a child
  that promotes several numbers makes its candidate list once, after all of
  them.  −3% to −23% time.
* **Nogoods** (tactic `nogoods`, sound).  A conflict `K` found at a node with
  promotions `P` is relative to `P`; a minimal subset of `P ∪ K` that keeps
  a frame of the *root* unwinnable is a *nogood*: it cannot be promoted from
  the root, so at every node anywhere in the tree (any thread, any path, and
  after a resume) the nogood minus that node's promotions is a conflict of
  the node (a subset of a promotable set is promotable; the proof is in
  `model::Nogoods`).  Measured first: at 1184, 291k conflicts were computed
  but they were only 854 distinct nogoods — the search found the same few
  hundred over and over.  So each searcher keeps a table of them (at most
  65536, forgotten all at once when full; about a thousand are learned near
  n = 1200), and a node's conflict is the smallest the table knows within
  `P ∪ Q*` (of those as small, the one with the largest member); only when it knows none
  is one computed, and then learned.  Nogoods also rule candidates out of a
  child (a nogood all of whose other members the child promotes, indexed by
  member), beyond the conflicts known along the path.  Looking conflicts up
  rather than computing them is cheaper, and also better for the tree: the
  smallest of the many conflicts known is often smaller than the one the
  minimization of a single frame finds, and branching on it and on the
  child's propagation cut nodes (936: 320k → 50k).  The tree now depends on
  what the searcher has learned, so on its history (threads, interruptions),
  not only on the node; answers do not.  Alone, lookups gave most of it
  (880 → 39k nodes, 936 → 57k, 1184 → 287k); propagation alone, with every
  conflict computed and made a nogood, cut nodes less (880 → 61k) and cost
  more than it saved.
* **All members forced.**  When every member of the conflict is forced, no
  completion beats the incumbent: the node is done (free once strong
  branching has computed the bounds; only matters with `match_refine=0`,
  since refinement prunes those nodes first).
* **Bounds without a member from the potentials** (`MatchBound::bound_excluding`).
  With the conflicts looked up, matching repairs were two thirds of the
  time, nearly all of them for the bound without one member of a conflict
  (strong branching, and refinement's branches).  The level's potentials are
  a dual solution whose sum is its bound; without the member as a candidate
  they stay feasible, and lowering the member's potential and that of the
  factor it paid with as far as their remaining edges allow gives an upper
  bound at once: `value − x + y′ₓ + y′_w`.  At 1184 it shows 89% of the forced
  members forced (and is never below the exact value, which the matching
  tests check).  Strong branching (with `fix_forced`) and refinement solve
  only for the members it does not settle; when some member is forced, the
  node's loop ends after the child that promotes them (it covers every
  completion that can beat the incumbent), so no level is kept for it.  The
  same trees, 13–28% less time.
* **Forced members of the whole matching.**  The bound from the potentials
  is cheap enough to compute for every member of the heaviest matching, not
  only for the conflict's: at each check that refines (or wants a conflict)
  the forced members of `Q*` are found that way.  If the nogood table knows
  a conflict all of whose members are forced, or the conflict found is, the
  node is done (diagnostics had shown that refining by the fresh minimal
  conflict instead of the table's would prune 16% of the nodes left open:
  other conflicts matter).  Otherwise, if any are forced, the child promotes
  them all and strong branching is not needed; only when none is does strong
  branching solve for its conflict's members.  The table is scanned once
  for both (the smallest conflict, and any conflict all forced), its
  nogoods' members ordered with the conflict they came from first, as those
  are the likeliest to be missing at another node.  Nodes −8% (936) to −52%
  (1184), time −2% to −39%; 992 seeded with its optimum (the proof alone,
  one thread): 2.89M → 2.11M nodes.

  Tried and not kept: proving more members forced with the forced ones
  required (a second pass of the bounds from the potentials on a level with
  them promoted) pruned nothing more; skipping the exact solves of strong
  branching when the bounds from the potentials found some member forced
  (instead of whenever they found any candidate forced), or of the
  refinement's branches, or choosing the member to branch on by those bounds
  alone, each traded nodes for time at about even.
* **Cheaper children.**  Peeling had become the largest cost (37% of the
  time at 1215: promotions and the candidate filter's checks).  With the
  matching bound, a child's candidate list leaves out the Java's
  promotability checks: a candidate that cannot be promoted is found by the
  conflicts and nogoods anyway, and nodes stayed within ±8%.  The forced
  members are promoted together, each frame checked once
  (`Model::promote_all_using`) instead of two frames per member (together
  they fit the frames' freedoms exactly when no frame they touch ends below
  zero).  And blameGame is not computed with the matching bound: it never
  pruned where the matching bound did not (diagnostics: 0 at every check).
  −30% to −59% time.
* **Nogood signatures.**  The table's scans were then 17% of the time at
  1215 (a few hundred nogoods, a lookup per check).  Each nogood keeps a
  256-bit signature (bit `x mod 256` per member), and a scan skips those
  whose signature is not within the node's; the conflicts chosen are the
  same as before (the smallest, then the one with the largest member).
  −5% to −10%.
* **No preclusion table** (`preclusions` now off by default).  With the
  nogoods it no longer pays for its setup: the searches of 992 and 1215
  seeded with their optimum take +5% and −4% without it (one thread), and
  1101–1217 through `taxman solve` on 8 threads spent 53 s of its 131 s
  building tables (0.8 s per searched game, 4.4 s on one thread at 1215) and
  72 s searching; without them 80 s in all, the search 74 s.
* **No refinement where members are forced.**  A node with forced members
  has a single child, which promotes them; refining the node's conflict is
  left to that child.  Nodes +3% to +11%, time −2% to −8% (992 and 1215
  seeded with their optimum: −3.5% and −6.5%).

Tried and not kept in this round:

* Rounding the heaviest matching into an incumbent at every node (drop the
  smallest member of a conflict until the rest can be promoted, then fill
  greedily): five times slower per node, and the optimum of 1050 was found
  at the same step.
* A large-neighbourhood search before the search: free a window of the
  incumbent's members (by frame pair, or 15–40 consecutive members), keep
  the rest promoted, and search that unit with a node limit.  At 1025 it
  reached 25080 in 1.3 s (the search takes 11 s to), but the optimum, 7
  members out and 8 in from there across frames 1–4, was found only by the
  search, at about the same point (one thread: 160 s instead of 170 s).
  The incumbents of 1025 and 1050 improve late because the search reaches
  the subtree that holds them late, not because a nearby set is missed.

One thread, fast set (search seconds and nodes; 880 and 936 seeded from
optimal.json, the rest from `results/strict.jsonl`):

The hard games, standalone in the ladder as above, on an idle machine (search
seconds; with several threads the times vary from run to run with when the
optimum is found, so two runs are shown for the last version; in
parentheses, when the final incumbent was found):

| game | 8686be0, 8 threads | 8bcfd36, 8 threads | 8bcfd36, 2 threads |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1215 | 195.6 s (71.4) | 12.1 s (7.4), 9.8 s (2.6) | 35.7 s (13.8) |
| 1216 | 51.5 s (start) | 3.1 s, 3.3 s | 10.4 s |
| 1025 | 100.1 s (76.7) | 12.5 s (4.6), 23.9 s (15.0) | 93.5 s (70.0) |
| 992 | 71.4 s (56.8) | 11.8 s (11.4), 12.0 s (11.8) | 40.0 s (39.2) |
| 996 | 76.4 s (start) | 10.2 s, 10.0 s | 31.5 s |

`taxman solve 1001-1217 --threads 8 --tactic reuse_prev=off --tactic
revise_freedoms=off` (no unproven tactic) reproduces every score of
`results/strict.jsonl` in 164 s of game time; those results took 1244 s on
10 threads.  Its slowest games: 1025 21 s (110 s before), 1215 10 s (161 s),
1020 6 s (40 s).

Left to try: the incumbents of games like 992 and 1025, whose optimum the
search reaches late (992 on 8 threads: at 11.8 s of 12.0 s; seeded with its
optimum it takes about 6 s); the matching repairs, then about 40% of the
time (strong branching where nothing is forced, and refinement; see "Faster
nodes, same trees" for later); and the multi-thread search: each thread
learns its own nogoods (sharing them did not look worth it: a proof on 8
threads takes about as many nodes as on one).
