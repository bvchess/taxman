# The root gap and the size of a game (2026-10)

Part of the [lab notebook](../../README.md).

Started 2026-10-23.

**Question.**  What decides how many steps a game of the chain takes?  The first findings are that the root's gap does
not, that a game's size is decided below the root, and that hard games differ from easy ones in how far the bound falls
at side branches in the top of the tree.  The entry is a log, and the work goes on with the [profile of a
search](../../../docs/design/engine.md#the-profile-of-a-search), which `taxman solve --profile DIR` records.  A game is
named by n.

## 2026-10-23: the root's gap does not predict a game's size

The root's gap does not predict the steps of a game: across the chain's games it has the wrong sign (r = -0.71).  The
data are 35 searched games, 4851 to 4945, each run as a ladder of 2,000 steps with `--profile`, and a script
(`gapfit.py`, in the lab's work folder `~/taxman_work/lab/work/rootgap/`) fitted the steps to the root gap:

* games 4900 to 4929 all have a root gap of 2,048, and took 2.3 × 10⁸ to 4.0 × 10⁸ steps;
* games 4935 to 4945 have root gaps of 2,137 to 2,191, and took 0.8 × 10⁸ to 1.3 × 10⁸ steps.

So a game's size is decided below the root.

## 2026-10-23: game 4949, the first chain game profiled whole

In a game's tree a few subtrees hold nearly all of the steps, and a subtree's size follows its gap.  Game 4949 took
82.5 × 10⁶ steps, and the profile gives:

* the largest subtree holds 88% of the steps at depth 4, 36% at depth 17, and 5.6% at depth 30, where the largest 100
  hold 76%;
* within the game a subtree's size follows its gap: +0.42 decades of steps per 100 of gap, with a rank correlation of
  0.88 to 0.96 at depths 4, 17 and 30;
* the profile made 91,565 ids, close to the limit of 100,000 a game;
* a step cost 1.24 ms on 86 threads: the GF(2) bound 66%, conflict branching's pricing 20% and strong branching 7%;
* steps lie at nodes of 130 to 210 promotions.

A subtree thus grows about 2.6 times per 100 of gap, so a tighter bound everywhere and a cheaper GF(2) solve are the two
levers.

## 2026-10-23: hard games and easy games at the top of the tree

In hard games the gaps of the nodes made at depths 12 to 21 stay high, which the first path does not show.  The runs are
ladders at afbc256 with `--seed-opt` on 8 threads, about 270,000 steps each, and their scripts are in the lab's work
folder `~/taxman_work/lab/work/rootgap/top/`.

* **Along the first path** the gap ends about the same: 2,048 to 1,841 by depth 8 in the hard games 4921 and 4929, and
  2,191 to 1,855 by depth 10 in the easy games 4941 and 4945.
* **Across the nodes made** the p90 of the gaps at depths 12, 15, 18 and 21 is 1,631, 1,620, 1,620 and 1,175 in the hard
  games, and 996, 766, 671 and 578 in the easy ones.
* **Neighbouring games share the top of their tree**: 4921 and 4929 have the same gaps at every depth, as do 4941 and
  4945, which is why hard and easy games come in runs.

**Open hypothesis.**  In hard games, excluding a member leaves near-equal alternatives, so the bound barely falls at a
side branch.  Nothing here tests it.

## Files

The scripts and their output are in the lab's work folder on the machine of the chain, not copied here:
`~/taxman_work/lab/work/rootgap/` has `gapfit.py` and the 35 ladder runs, and its `top/` has the scripts of the
top-of-tree runs.
