# Carrying nogoods over (2026-10): measured, not kept

Part of the [lab notebook](../README.md).

A nogood is a fact about the root of a game's frame model, and consecutive
games have nearly the same model, so the nogoods a search ends with could
start the tables of the next game's search, each checked at the new root
first: a set that cannot be promoted from the root (an exact test, frame by
frame) is a nogood of it whatever it came from, and `conflict_using` makes it
minimal again.  For the same reason a checkpoint could store the tables and a
resumed search start with them.  A prototype measured both (commit f41fff8:
`search::valid_nogoods`, the solver's tactic `carry_nogoods`, `ladder
--carry`, `examples/resume_carry.rs`); neither pays, and both were taken out
again.

* Nearly every nogood survives into the next game: 1374 of 1374 from 1024 at
  1025, 482 of 494 from 1219 at 1220, 1216 of 1251 from 1229 at 1230.  But
  game n − 1 often does not search: a prime takes the shortcut, and 1214,
  1224 and 1226 reach the cap with their seed (no nodes), so in a range the
  nogoods come from the last game searched (1227's from 1225, through 1226).
* The table never stops growing, but learning costs little.  On one thread,
  half of what a hard game learns is learned in the first 3–27% of its search,
  90% by 18–64%, and the last nogood in its last 1–17% (1024, 1025, 1215,
  1219, 1220, 1225, and 1230 stopped at 560 s); each is one conflict computed
  where the table knew none, a few thousand in a search of millions of nodes.
  So what a preloaded table could save is not the learning but the search's
  knowing smaller conflicts sooner, which changes the tree.
* It changes, but not for the better (one thread, strict tactics, seeded from
  n − 1 and capped as the solver does; search seconds and nodes):

  | game | tables start empty | with the nogoods of |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1025 | 158 s 8.50M | 1024: 136 s 6.30M |
  | 1025, proof only (seeded with its optimum) | 99 s 5.25M | 1024: 104 s 4.97M |
  | 1220 | 186 s 13.72M | 1219: 232 s 16.47M |
  | 1220, proof only | 177 s 13.51M | 1219: 240 s 17.81M |
  | 1227 | 260 s 17.42M | 1225: 267 s 15.72M |
  | 1230 | open at 560 s (best 36570 at 118 s) | 1229: open at 560 s (36570 at 186 s) |
  | 1025, 4 threads | 35.2 s 8.51M | 1024: 38.4 s 6.82M |
  | 1220, 4 threads | 54.0 s 17.16M | 1219: 68.0 s 15.91M |

  1227 is the ceiling: 1225–1229 have the same frames and candidates (the
  same search, 17,417,736 nodes on one thread), so 1227 started with all that
  1225 learned is the best a carried table can be, and it takes 10% fewer
  nodes and 3% more time.  The chain `taxman solve 1201-1231 --threads 4
  --tactic reuse_prev=off --tactic revise_freedoms=off` from 1200 in
  `results/strict.jsonl` took 617 s (154.7M nodes) without and 941 s (174.7M)
  with it, every searched game slower (1230: 305 s against 445 s); there the
  table grows from game to game.
* Why: a larger table costs every node.  A lookup scans every nogood's
  signature and the nogoods of each new promotion rule candidates out, so
  nodes are slower the more the table holds (1227: 59k nodes/s from a full
  table against 67k/s from an empty one; on 4 threads, whose tables start
  with the union of all threads' nogoods, 177k/s against 242k/s at 1025).
* Keeping the tables over a resume: a search stopped every K nodes and
  resumed from its checkpoint, with the tables as they were when it stopped
  (in memory, what a stored table would give), reproduces the uninterrupted
  search; resumed with empty tables it is a different tree, and faster (one
  thread):

  | game, stopped every | uninterrupted | resumed with empty tables | with the tables kept |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1024, 250k nodes | 41 s 2.28M | 34 s 2.32M | 42 s 2.26M |
  | 1215, 500k | 66 s 5.49M | 60 s 6.22M | 69 s 5.47M |
  | 1220, 1.5M | 186 s 13.72M | 143 s 11.91M | 191 s 13.48M |

  So a resume loses nothing by starting empty, and checkpoints stay as they
  were.  That old nogoods cost more than they help is taken up in
  "Forgetting nogoods", below.

Noticed on the way: many games of a range have exactly the frames and
candidates of an earlier one (in 1201–1231: 1202–1203 those of 1201, 1205 of
1204, 1207 of 1206, 1210–1211 of 1209, 1213–1214 of 1212, 1217 of 1216, 1219
of 1218, 1222–1223 of 1221, 1226–1229 of 1225, 1231 of 1230), so the same best
promotion set, which a search of one of them has already established.  Only
the cap differs: where it is higher than the optimum, the search is repeated
in full.  In the strict chain above that is 1203, 1205, 1207, 1211, 1219 and
1227: 90 s of the 617 s.
