# Same search (2026-10)

Part of the [lab notebook](../README.md).

*Question.*  Rank 1 of [IDEAS.md](../ideas-from-other-fields-the-pilots-2026-10/README.md#1-the-recommended-order): many games pose exactly the search problem of an
earlier game of the chain (the same frames, candidates, `max_total` and factor graph; only the cap differs), so they
have its best promotion sum, yet the solver proves it again.  How many, what does it cost, and does concluding them
from the earlier game hold up?  The pilot ([IDEAS.md 4.1](../ideas-from-other-fields-the-pilots-2026-10/README.md#41-memoizing-searches-that-repeat-rank-1)) hashed the
root frames, the candidates and `max_total` with Rust's `DefaultHasher`; this round makes it a proof kind (commits
f5a2af3 and 1cc4067; DESIGN.md, ["Same search"](../../docs/design/same-search.md), has the argument).

*Method.*  The problem is written out canonically (`search::Problem`, which also records the model's factor lists and
home frames for every number of the frames) and compared whole; the digest only finds candidates.  The repeats are
found from the setups alone, with no search: `cargo run --release --example repeats -- 1 1300 --known
results/strict.jsonl` sets up every game of 1..1300 that is neither prime nor trivial as a strict run does, finds
the latest earlier game with an equal problem, and adds up the `seconds.search_all_runs` that the committed strict
chain spent on each repeat (8.4 s for the 1076 setups, about 8 ms a game; 25–30 ms near 1300).

*How many, and how far back.*  545 of the 1076 games of 1..1300 that set a search up repeat an earlier game: 416 in
1..1000, 100 in 1001..1231 (12 of them in 1201..1231) and 29 in 1232..1300.  Each repeats the last board size before
it that set a search up: n − 1 for 471, n − 2 for 74, and for every one of those 74, n − 1 is prime.  So a window of 8
board sizes (`SAME_SEARCH_WINDOW`) misses none, and the setups a range must make for lines that record no digest
(schema 3) stay at eight.

*What they cost in the committed `strict.jsonl`* (6 threads, commit bd9bb5d), so what a rerun of its chain would not
spend:

| range | repeats | their search | the range's search | share |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1..1000 | 416 | 29.0 s | 82.8 s | 35.0% |
| 1001..1231 | 100 | 72.9 s | 409.7 s | 17.8% |
| (1201..1231) | 12 | 45.8 s | 276 s | 16.6% |
| 1232..1300 | 29 | 851.2 s | 2866.3 s | 29.7% |
| 1..1300 | 545 | 953.1 s | 3358.8 s | 28.4% |

The repeats of 1232..1300 (game ← the game it repeats, its committed search seconds): 1234←1233 0.1, 1238←1236 0.1,
1241←1240 6.7, 1243←1242 3.6, 1244←1243 0.1, 1246←1245 0.1, 1247←1246 3.6, 1252←1251 0.1, 1253←1252 3.8, 1255←1254
24.2, 1257←1256 23.0, 1258←1257 0.1, 1261←1260 48.2, 1262←1261 0.1, 1263←1262 51.3, 1266←1265 0.1, 1267←1266 63.6,
1268←1267 0.1, 1270←1269 0.1, 1271←1270 75.3, 1273←1272 38.5, 1276←1275 0.1, 1282←1281 0.1, 1285←1284 36.1,
1286←1285 0.1, 1293←1292 207.1, 1294←1293 0.1, 1298←1296 0.1, 1299←1298 265.1.  The pilot named the first game of
each class (1299 repeats 1296, 1263 and 1261 repeat 1260); the solver takes the latest, which is the same problem.
The searches of 0.1 s are the ones that reached the cap at once: a repeat saves little there, and much where the
earlier game's proof is a long exhausted search.

*At the frontier, without big runs.*  The committed `strict.jsonl` cut after 1298 (its lines for n ≤ 1298, incomplete
ones included) and extended with `taxman solve 1299 --strict --threads 2 --out FILE`: 1299 is a repeat of 1298, 0.079
s for the game and 0.46 s for the whole process (opening and checking the 1301 lines, and setting the window's eight
schema-3 games up again), score 531389 as committed, against 265 s of search in the committed run.  The same from the
file cut after 1292: 1293 repeats 1292 (0.081 s, 526200; 207 s committed) and 1294 repeats 1293, itself a repeat
(0.082 s); cut after 1270: 1271 repeats 1270 (0.064 s, 509880; 75 s committed).  Every file passes `taxman
verify-results` and `solver/tools/check_results.py`.

*Chains with the tactic on and off.*  The strict chain 1..300 concludes 107 games as repeats with the tactic on
(proofs: trivial 13, prime 62, cap 34, exhausted 84, same_search 107), against cap 101 and exhausted 124 with it off,
every score the same; its repeats are exactly the 107 that the setups alone find.  With `revise_freedoms` on as well
(only `reuse_prev` off) there are 107 repeats too, 69 of the 300 games resting on `revise_freedoms`.  With the default
tactics `taxman regress --to 400` has no repeat at all (trivial 13, prime 78, reuse 200, repeat 0, search 109):
`reuse_prev`, which comes first, accepts every game whose problem is its predecessor's; `--strict` gives repeat 151,
search 158.  The probe's fingerprint is unchanged (6197a47eae6cf8c8; the shortcut is outside the search), and
`cargo test --release` passes, with `tests/same_search.rs` (2.7 s) and the forged repeats of `tests/results.rs`.

*Decision.*  Kept: tactic `same_search`, on by default and in strict runs; proof `same_search`, results schema 4.  A
rerun of the strict chain to 1300 would skip 28% of its search time, and the frontier games that repeat cost
nothing; it changes no score, tree or node count of a game that is searched.  Verifying a repeat sets two problems up
again (the verifier caches them by board size), so a schema-4 chain to 1300 will take a few seconds more to open.

## Later (2026-10): the program removed from master

The example `repeats` was removed from master on 2026-10-17.  It builds at commit 8753189: `git checkout 8753189`, then
`cargo build --release --example repeats` in `rust/`.
