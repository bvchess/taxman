# Single-member conflicts belong to the node (2026-10)

Part of the [lab notebook](../EXPERIMENTS.md).

Many of the conflicts the search computes have one member (`--diag`'s minimal
conflict sizes: the 25th percentile is 1 at 936, the 10th at 1184).  They
looked like candidates that the Java's filter lets through and that cannot be
promoted from the root at all, which every searcher, work unit and resume
would find again; testing each candidate once from the root and dropping the
failures would then be free.  They are not root facts:

* **The frame builder's candidates all pass that test.**  A hive's promotion
  candidates are its factors that can leave it (the remaining sources can
  still be matched without them) and that some hive can take on as a source,
  which comes to what `Model::can_promote` checks at the root (the home frame
  without the factor, the frame below with it as a move).  For every game from
  2 to 1230 none of the candidates fails that check (a test), so a filter at
  the root drops nothing.  A version built as a tactic (the checkpoint header
  recording the candidates it leaves, older checkpoints refused as a different
  candidate set) searched 936, 1100, 1184 and 1215 on one thread in exactly the
  same nodes as without it (58,903, 56,399, 167,960 and 5,161,817), with 0 of
  225, 273, 287 and 302 candidates dropped; it was not kept.
* **The conflicts are relative to the node.**  A nogood of one member would be
  a candidate that cannot be promoted from the root, so the table never holds
  one.  A single-member conflict is a candidate that cannot be promoted once the
  node's promotions are made (its frame may have used it up in a forced pair,
  say); in another branch, with other promotions, it is a nogood of two or more
  members.  Looking it up is cheap, and the node's loop then goes on without
  the candidate.
* **Little is left to save.**  The promotions that fail are 2,282 of 58,903
  steps at 936 (3.9%) and 698 of 167,960 at 1184 (0.4%) (`--diag`, one thread),
  which bounds what a search that never tried a dead candidate could gain.
